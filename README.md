# CTF Write-Ups Portfolio

This repository contains curated Capture The Flag (CTF) write-ups demonstrating
practical skills in vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and secure coding concepts.

The goal of these write-ups is to clearly explain **what the vulnerability was,
why it existed, and how it was exploited**, with an emphasis on defensive lessons
and mitigation.

## 🧠 Focus Areas
- Web Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Binary Exploitation (intro)
- General Security Concepts

## ✍️ Write-Up Philosophy
Each write-up includes:
- Clear problem understanding
- Root cause analysis of the vulnerability
- Minimal but meaningful exploitation steps
- Mitigation strategies and lessons learned

I avoid copy-paste command dumps and instead focus on **communicating technical understanding**.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All write-ups are based on **intentionally vulnerable challenges** and are for
educational purposes only.  
No active machines or restricted challenges are documented.
